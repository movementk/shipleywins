                Does the PT slide introduce the company filled with history and technical descriptions that no one cares about? The purpose of the Company introduction PT is also to " Selling." This means that a successful company presentation must stay on the Selling Point and Customer-focus. Shipley's Company Presentation Consulting offers the solution.

                                Company introduction materials are also part of sales materials. You can develop a company introduction presentation that effectively represents your solutions to your customer's needs and value beyond company history and technology descriptions.

                            <p>
                                The company introduction material is easy to be made up of a list of information to introduce the company. Through the consultation, do not list the introductory information, but develop an introductory material with clear "message" to deliver. This allows prospective customers to intuitively understand the message you want to deliver.

                            <p>
                                The presentation should be both logical and emotionally reliable. The body of the presentation consists of persuasive contents, and the opening and closing should be able to use the emotional slides to affect the customer's perception and emotion.
