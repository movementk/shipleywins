                    <p>
                        Thank you for visiting Shipley Korea.<br>
                        Ever since Shipley Korea introduced contract winning consultation to Korea in 2008, we have achieved win rate of 85% and won 20 trillion (KRW) in contracts (at the end of 2016 based on contract amount).<br><br>
                        The achievement that we believe to be more meaningful is that our client companies understand that competing with their abilities with proper contracts are shortcut to long-term development of the company and that they support Shipley Korea’s philosophy. <br><br>
                        Shipley Korea goes further to actively support Korean companies to overseas expansion.<br><br>
                        We succeeded in becoming a company that provides total solution starting from market research, buyer discovery, developing contracting strategy, proposal provision and to presentation coaching not only to big corporates but also to small/medium companies. <br>
                        Shipley Headquarters located in America aided in success of clients’ global businesses via utilizing networks built from 16 countries and about 1200 consultants for the past 45 years.<br>
                        43 companies from Fortune 500’s Top50 companies are already partners with Shipley.<br>
                        
                    </p>
