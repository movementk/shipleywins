                It is usually said, “You need to have a good presentation skill for PT” or “You need to have a good design for PT”.  It may be true for general PT, but not true for competitive PT. It is important for competitive PT to get a good evaluation, for which distinct strategy and contents need to be first developed. While presentation is important, Q&amp;A is considered more important. These principles are also applied to international competitive PT.<br>
                Do you need to prepare PT to win contracts for important international projects? Shipley, the professional consulting company to win international projects, leads you to win in  competitive PT through ‘distinct strategy, contents, design, speaker coaching, and Q&amp;A preparation.’
