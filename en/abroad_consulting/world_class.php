            <p class="summary">
                The government operates the ‘world-class 300’ project to make 300 global companies at the world-class by supporting mid to small size companies in Korea.<br>
                Designation strategy and growth strategy are different, growth strategy is literally a strategy for 'growth‘ of company, and designation strategy is a strategy for good evaluation in the world-class 300 project.<br>
                People tend to think that they can be selected by submitting proposals with 'growth' strategy of their companies. However, they do need a separate ‘designation strategy (Communication)’ to be highly evaluated.<br>
                Shipley focuses on a balance between growth strategy and  world-class 300 designation strategy in growth strategy proposal in order to help you be selected in the world-class 300 project at once.
