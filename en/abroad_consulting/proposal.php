                        which is what a chief consultant of Shipley AP said after reading an existing international project proposal of the company when visiting for consulting their international proposal.<br> A proposal is a sales document to persuade clients, not a document that lists technologies. Since, nevertheless, most proposals are written in the view of writer rather than client, it is hard to get a good evaluation. In particular, it is even more difficult for international projects to compete with international companies that are equipped with client-focused proposals.   
                        Do you have any important project that you must win the contract? Shipley’s international proposal development consulting will be effective.

                                                Instead of a proposal only filling out contents required by RFP(Request For Proposal), you will develop a strategic proposal that has a clear strategic focus in the midst of competition over official/unofficial issues, which will maximize the chance to win a contract.

                                                Instead of writing what you want to present, you will develop a proposal  from the view of client (a proposal  that is easy to be evaluated and understood, and a client's need-based proposal , not our solution-focused one), so that you should be able to win a contract.

                                                Speaking Korean doesn’t guarantee to write a good proposal in Korean. Likewise, speaking English fluently does not always coincide with writing a good international proposal. In Shipley, an Australian Technical  Writer with 25 years of experiences  will review and revise your proposal  to be client’s need-based and relevant to sales (Proof reading). In addition, he will make expressions, words and sentences  natural and smooth.
